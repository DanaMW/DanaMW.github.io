    <P><a>Maybe hell is a place you go when you die that all the dreams you escaped from by waking up are waiting for you.</a></p>
    <p><a>'If numbers cannot have infinite strings of digits, then the future can never be perfectly preordained. Strangely, although we feel as if we sweep through time on the knife-edge between the fixed past and the open future, that edge — the present — appears nowhere in the existing laws of physics. In Albert Einstein’s theory of relativity, for example, time is woven together with the three dimensions of space, forming a bendy, four-dimensional space-time continuum — a “block universe” encompassing the entire past, present and future. Einstein’s equations portray everything in the block universe as decided from the beginning; the initial conditions of the cosmos determine what comes later, and surprises do not occur — they only seem to. “For us believing physicists,” Einstein wrote in 1955, weeks before his death, “the distinction between past, present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion.”' - Dave Whyte for Quanta Magazine</a></p>
