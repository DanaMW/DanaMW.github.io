    <p><a>Today is update and publish day.</a></p>
    <p><a>New pictures added to the Gallery. Check out the work.</a></p>
    <p><a>Congratulations to my daughter Fiamma that scored in the 99 percentile for the state and 96 percentile for the
            country on her SAT/ACT. And she is only 16 :)</a></p>
    <p><a>I am going to redo the Gmail Dark script to get the email to show right. So look for a change in a few
            days.</a></p>
    <p><a>I don't have much to say unless you want to whip up a conversation about politics.<em>Humm?</em> Give me a
            minute. Since I just put the pages on-line it will be a year or two till I get it set up. :)</a></p>
    <p><a>I Have a habit of writing and working a lot with PowerShell Core. If you want to see the work or grab some
            scripts to use or customize for your system click the "PowersShell Repo" button on the left menu and have
            fun.</a></p>
