    <h1>Welcome to The Hangout!</h1>
</center>
<center>
    <p><a>Added Reddit Dark skin.</a></p>
    <p><a>I just added the new WT Social Dark skin for the new Social Media site wt.social to the css section.</a></p>
    <p><a>I finally added our Storms gallery. Sorry Iam slow on the pictures.</a></p>
    <p><a>Updated Tweetdeck to put the scrollbars back in. I intend to make this a toggle soon.</a></p>
    <p><a>My wife is supposed to do the pictures but she burns out fast. So I guess it is time that I take it over and
            actually do something with it.</a></p>
    <p><a>Updated google news to catch tabs I missed</a></p>
    <p><a>Updated Gmail to put the scroll bar back in because my wheel is wearing out :) (firefox)</a></p>
    <p><a>Working on updating the PowerShell repository (button on left) and the help for powershell and scripts under
            the Developments tab.</a></p>
    <p><a>All my css for Stylus and js for TamperMonkey are online now. Some of it like the discord scripts are linked
            to my repositories. Now I will workout some help files in Development for Firefox and Powershell. If you
            have any questions just click the Email Me link. Thanks for hanging out.</a></p>
    <p><a>Today is update and publish day.</a></p>
    <p><a>New pictures added to the Gallery. Check out the work.</a></p>
    <p><a>Congratulations to my daughter Fiamma that scored in the 99 percentile for the state and 96 percentile for the
            country on her SAT/ACT. And she is only 16 :)</a></p>
    <p><a>I am going to redo the Gmail Dark script to get the email to show right. So look for a change in a few
            days.</a></p>
    <p><a>I don't have much to say unless you want to whip up a conversation about politics.<em>Humm?</em> Give me a
            minute. Since I just put the pages on-line it will be a year or two till I get it set up. :)</a></p>
    <p><a>I Have a habit of writing and working a lot with PowerShell Core. If you want to see the work or grab some
            scripts to use or customize for your system click the "PowersShell Repo" button on the left menu and have
            fun.</a></p>
