            I am going to, before I leave this planet, try to jot down a few stories from my life that might be worth
            your time to hear. Let me see if I can do honor to the friends and stories as I write. They deserve it.

            Every story has a begining, and since this one is about a life, we would start at birth. Since I have no
            memory of birth, lets put a story flag at the young good years. There were NONE. Not one single year was
            good. My life was built on a foundation of abuse and hate and I got the lion share of it all. My earliest
            memory was of my step father, Charles Thompson, punching, slapping, and kicking me for anything I did wrong.
            One time I was standing next to him and being nosey about what he was doing in the trunk of the car.
            Annoyed, he picked me up and locked me in there. Normally this was not big deal, but he would not let me
            out. My mother finally heard me yelling, banging, and freaking out so she let me out. I was 3 or 4 at the
            time. Another fine time we went to a local carnival which had rides, so my brothers and I were looking
            forward to it. Oh yeah, this Thompson guy had 3 sons with my mother. I was the odd man out with a different
            father. At the fair we decided to ride the double ferris wheel. My mother rode with two of us, Charles with
            the other two. Wouldn't it just be my luck to be seated with him? Well the ferris wheel was loading a good
            crowd so we had the stop and go for a bit. We got... umm lucky... yeah lucky, to have stopped right smack
            damn on top; my hands were holding tight like they should. He looked over and saw my fear and well, did the
            most Charles thing he could think of. He started rocking that car faster and faster. I remember only sky and
            ground. Sky and ground. Well I guess the next county heard me because the ride operator got me to the bottom
            in short order and let me off. All that was left was a shaking child who would fear heights for the rest of
            his life. A few weeks later, my brother and I were sitting on the sun porch watching tv and eating tuna
            sandwiches. I heard a knock on the window behind me. I jumped up on my knees and turned around to find a
            face inches away from mine with a stocking over it. The eyes were slanted from the stocking and it stared
            straight at me with an evil menace. All I could do was scream in fear. Funny what people remember in fear,
            but I remember looking over at my younger brother and he mashed his tuna over his own face to hide it. After
            the second look away it was gone, but I can tell you that to this day there can't be cracks in my curtains.
            The fear of a child never lets go completely. These things and many other will need to be added to the
            beatings he gave me for things i did wrong. So many beating so violent so much hate crashing down on my
            little self. And that was my first year of life I remember clearly. The Begining.</a>

            I ran away from home at 10 and never went back. Lived on the streets of Silver Creek NY for 2 years. A dirty
            little street person who's home was so shitty the nasty streets were better than it. Two years I skated
            until the county caught me and stuck me in foster care. So from 12 to 16 i was a ward of the county. I
            emancipated myself at 16 quit my job walked to the thruway and climbed the fence and thumbed to Florida. And
            the rest, as they say, is history. I built myself a world traveled life of strange stories. Hope you enjoy.
            I learned about sex, or a form of it on the streets from watching a couple do it right there in front of me.
            I was not having anything to do with it personally but I think that is where I became a bit of a voyeur.
