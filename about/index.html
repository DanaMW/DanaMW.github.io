            I am going to, before I leave this planet, try to jot down a few stories from my life that might be worth
            your time to hear. Let me se if I can do honor to the friends and stories as I write.

            Every story has a begining and since it about a life we would start at birth. Since I have no memory of
            birth lets put story flag at the young good years. There were NONE. Not one single year was good. My life
            was built on a foundation of abuse and hate. And I got the lion share of it all. My earliest memory was of
            my step father, Charles Thompson, punching and slapping and kicking me for something I did wrong. One time i
            was standing next to him and being nosy about what he was doing in the trunk of the car and he picked me up
            and locked me in there. Normally not big deal but he would let me out my mother finally heard me yelling
            banging and freaking out and let me out. I was 3 or 4 at the time. Another fine time we went to a local
            carnival and they had rides so my brothers and i were looking forward to it. Oh yeah this Thompson guy had 3
            sons with my mother I was the odd man out with a different father. Well at the fair we decided to ride the
            double ferris wheel. My mother rode with two and Charles two and wouldn't it just be my luck to be seated
            with him. Well the ferris wheel was loading a good crowd s we had the stop and go for a bit. We got umm
            lucky yeah lucky to have stopped right smack damn on top and my hand were holding tight like they should. He
            looked over and saw my fear and well did the most Charles thing he could think of. He stared rocking that
            car faster and faster and i remomber only sky and ground. Sky and ground. Well I guess the next county heard
            me because the ride operator got me to the bottom in short order and let me off. All that was left was a
            shaking child who would fear heights for the rest if his life. A few weeks later my brother and I were
            sitting on the sun porch watching tv and eating tuna sandwiches. I heard a knock on the window behind me
            and I jumped up on my knees and turned around to find a face inches away from mine with a stocking over it.
            The eyes were slanted from the stocking and he stared straight at me with an evil. All i could do is scream
            in fear. Funny what people remember in fear but I remember looking over at my younger brother nd he mashed
            his tuna over his face to hide it. After the second look away he was gone but I can tell you that to this
            day there can't be cracks in my curtains because the fear of a child never lets go completely. I did not
            know telling these stories would be sso hard on me so let me take a break and I will get right back to them.
